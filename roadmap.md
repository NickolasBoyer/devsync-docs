# Roadmap

This is where a roadmap will be published later this week along with common feedback we are receiving.

## Next update
- Editing of unbundled/unsourcemapped CSS
- Smart-check when deleting CSS properties (in addition to the current smart check on changing properties)

## Planned
- Small code editor in extension to be able to manually edit code as well.
- More to come...
